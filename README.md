# Longform
WordPress theme for personal project

Longform is a collection of online, longform writing from or about South Africa.

This is a personal side project. No ownership or copyright of items linked to is implied.

While you're welcome to use anything you find here, I strongly advise you not to, this is all for a personal project, enabling me to play around with a variety of tools.
